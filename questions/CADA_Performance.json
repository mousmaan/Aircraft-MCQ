      "detailed": "The power required curve shows how much power is needed to fly at different speeds. At very low speeds, this power requirement is very high due to induced drag. The aircraft can only maintain a speed if the power available from the engine is greater than or equal to the power required. The absolute minimum speed the aircraft can maintain in level flight occurs at the point where the rising 'back side' of the power required curve intersects the power available line. Any attempt to fly slower than this speed would require more power than the engine can provide, resulting in a stall or descent. This is the theoretical power-on stalling speed.

      "detailed": "In normal flight, if a pilot wants to slow down, they reduce power. However, on the 'back of the power curve'—the part of the curve to the left of the minimum power speed—the opposite is true. As the aircraft slows down, induced drag increases so dramatically that the total power required to stay level also increases. Therefore, to fly slower in this region, the pilot must add more power. This is a critical concept for pilots, especially during a landing approach, as reducing speed without adding power will lead to an increased rate of descent, which can be hazardous at low altitudes.

The ratio of this total lift to the aircraft's weight is the load factor.

However, a major advantage is that a high wing loading makes the aircraft less susceptible to being disturbed by gusts and turbulence, providing a much smoother ride for passengers.

The radius of a turn is determined by two main factors: bank angle and true airspeed. Since the bank angle is being held constant, the increase in true airspeed is the deciding factor. According to the turn performance formulae, the radius is proportional to the velocity squared (Radius ∝ V²).

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "brief": "If the angle of attack and bank are held constant, adding power will increase thrust. Since the lift and drag are fixed by the constant AoA and speed, this excess thrust will cause the aircraft to start climbing in a spiral path.",
    "detailed": "In a stable turn, all forces are balanced. If a pilot adds power, the thrust will now be greater than the drag, causing the aircraft to accelerate. However, if the pilot also maintains the same angle of attack, the increasing airspeed will cause the lift to increase significantly (Lift ∝ V²). With lift now greater than the forces required for a level turn, and thrust greater than drag, the excess energy will be converted into a gain in altitude. The aircraft will therefore begin to fly in an ascending spiral, or a climbing turn. From Topic: Turning (Section 9.10 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics).",

    "answer": "C",
    "brief": "The total mechanical energy of an aircraft in flight is the sum of its potential energy, which is determined by its altitude, and its kinetic energy, which is determined by its airspeed. Pilots can manage flight by trading one form of energy for the other.",
    "detailed": "Thinking in terms of energy management is a key piloting skill. An aircraft's potential energy is its 'height bank account'—the higher it is, the more stored energy it has. Its kinetic energy is its 'speed bank account'—the faster it is, the more energy of motion it has. A pilot can make a 'withdrawal' from the height account to 'deposit' into the speed account by diving. Conversely, they can use excess speed (kinetic energy) to gain height (potential energy) in a climb. The engine's purpose is to add energy to this system to counteract the energy lost to drag.
