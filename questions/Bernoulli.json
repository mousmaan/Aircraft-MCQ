    "brief": "In the narrowest section (throat) of a venturi, air is forced to accelerate, which increases its speed (dynamic pressure). To maintain a constant total energy, its static pressure (potential energy) must decrease as a result.",
    "detailed": "Consider the total energy of the air as a constant value, composed of both Static Pressure and Dynamic Pressure. When air flows through a constricted passage like a venturi's throat, it must speed up. This increase in speed means its Dynamic Pressure (the energy of motion) increases. Since the total energy must remain constant, the Static Pressure (potential energy) must decrease to compensate for this increased speed. This same 'suction' effect is what helps generate lift over a wing.",

    "detailed": "When a fast-moving jet of air flows, it pulls the surrounding still air along with it (a process called 'entrainment'), which creates a low-pressure area. When this occurs near a curved surface, the pressure between the jet and the surface becomes even lower. The higher atmospheric pressure from the outside then pushes the jet stream against the surface, causing it to adhere and follow the curve. This is the essence of the Coanda effect.",

    "brief": "The Coanda effect is crucial because it forces the airflow to adhere to the curved upper surface of the wing. This action causes the air to be deflected downwards, and according to Newton's laws, this creates an opposite upward reaction force (lift).",
    "detailed": "The Coanda effect is the reason why airflow, after passing over the top of the wing, doesn't just continue in a straight line but follows the wing's shape. This downward turning of the air (known as 'downwash') is an action. According to Newton's Third Law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, the reaction to pushing a mass of air downwards is an upward force on the wing, which we define as lift.",

    "brief": "The lowest pressure on a wing is found on its curved upper surface, typically near the point of maximum thickness. This is because the air must travel a longer distance at a faster speed in this region to meet the air from the lower surface.",
    "detailed": "When airflow splits at the leading edge of a wing, the air traveling over the top has a longer, curved path to follow than the air below. To cover this longer distance in roughly the same amount of time, it must accelerate to a higher speed. According to Bernoulli's principle, where the speed is higher, the static pressure is lower. This low-pressure 'suction' area on the upper surface is the largest single contributor to the total lift force.",
