      "answer": "C",
      "brief": "Aileron drag, or adverse yaw, is caused by the extra drag created by the downward-deflected aileron on the rising wing. This aileron produces more lift, and as a result, also produces more induced drag, which pulls that wing backward.",
      "detailed": "When a pilot initiates a turn, the aileron on the wing that is intended to rise goes down. This downward deflection increases the camber of that wing section, which increases its lift. A fundamental principle of aerodynamics is that an increase in lift always comes with an increase in induced drag. Therefore, the downward-deflected aileron on the rising wing creates significantly more drag than the upward-deflected aileron on the descending wing. This imbalance in drag causes the rising wing to be pulled backward, making the aircraft's nose yaw in the opposite direction of the intended turn. This effect is most prominent at low airspeeds where more aileron deflection is needed. From Topic: Control (Exercise A6, Question 19 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

      "answer": "C",
      "brief": "In a turn, the pilot must increase the angle of attack to generate more total lift to maintain altitude. This higher angle of attack significantly increases induced drag, and more power (thrust) is required to overcome this extra drag and maintain a constant airspeed.",
      "detailed": "To maintain altitude in a turn, the total lift produced by the wings must be greater than the aircraft's weight. This is because only the vertical component of the lift is opposing weight. To generate this extra lift at a constant airspeed, the pilot must increase the wing's angle of attack. A higher angle of attack always results in a greater amount of induced drag. If the pilot does not add power to increase thrust, this extra drag will cause the aircraft to slow down. Therefore, to maintain both a constant altitude and a constant airspeed in a turn, power must be added to counteract the increase in induced drag.

      "detailed": "Adverse yaw is caused by the drag imbalance between the rising and descending wings. A differential aileron system addresses this by creating a counteracting drag force. The linkage is designed so that when the pilot commands a roll, the aileron moving up (on the descending wing) travels a greater distance than the aileron moving down (on the rising wing). This larger upward deflection creates a significant amount of parasite drag.

      "brief": "In any turn, the wing on the outside of the turn must travel a greater distance in the same amount of time as the inner wing. Because this outer wing is moving faster through the air, it generates more lift, which creates a rolling moment that tends to increase the bank angle.",
      "detailed": "During a turn, the aircraft pivots around a central point. This means the wingtip on the outside of the turn has a larger circle to trace than the wingtip on the inside. Since both wingtips complete their circle in the same amount of time, the outer wing must be travelling at a higher true airspeed. According to the lift formula, lift is proportional to the square of the velocity. Therefore, the faster-moving outer wing will generate more lift than the slower-moving inner wing. This lift imbalance creates a continuous rolling moment that tries to steepen the bank. The pilot must use a small amount of opposite aileron to hold a constant bank angle.

      "detailed": "The Frise aileron is another clever design to combat adverse yaw. Its hinge point is set back from its leading edge. When the pilot commands a roll and the aileron on the descending wing moves up, this offset hinge causes the aileron's leading edge to project downwards into the smooth airflow beneath the wing. This protrusion creates a significant amount of parasite drag on the descending wing. This drag is carefully calculated to be roughly equal to the high induced drag being created by the downward-deflected aileron on the rising wing. By balancing the drag on both wings, the Frise aileron minimizes adverse yaw and promotes a coordinated turn. From Topic: Control (Section 12.5, Figure 12.14 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

At a higher speed, the aircraft has more inertia and requires a much larger centripetal force (or a much larger radius) to change direction.

This is governed by the horizontal component of lift, which provides the centripetal force for the turn. When a pilot increases the angle of bank, a larger portion of the total lift vector is directed horizontally towards the center of the turn. This stronger turning force causes the aircraft to change its direction more rapidly, thus increasing the rate of turn.

      "detailed": "The standard overbanking tendency caused by the outer wing's higher speed is amplified during a climbing turn. Because the aircraft is following an upward-spiraling path, the wing on the outside of the turn is physically ascending at a steeper angle relative to the horizon than the inner wing.

The combination of both these effects—higher speed and higher angle of attack—causes the outer wing to generate substantially more lift than the inner wing, leading to a much more pronounced tendency to overbank that the pilot must actively correct.

The radius of a turn is proportional to the square of the velocity, so reducing the speed significantly reduces the radius. Furthermore, the rate of turn is a measure of how quickly the turn is completed. Since the aircraft is now flying a much smaller circle at a slightly slower speed, the time it takes to complete the turn is reduced, which means the rate of turn (degrees per second) has increased.

In these conditions (e.g., just after takeoff or on approach to land), the pilot needs to use large aileron inputs to make the aircraft roll. This large deflection on the rising wing creates a very large increase in induced drag, causing a powerful yawing motion away from the turn.

However, in a descending turn, the aircraft is following a downward-spiraling path. This means the outer wing, while moving faster horizontally, is also on the 'down-going' side of the spiral. This causes it to meet the relative airflow at a lower angle of attack than the inner wing. The effect of this lower angle of attack (which reduces lift) often cancels out, or even outweighs, the effect of the higher speed (which increases lift).

This means the inner wing is actually rising relative to the flight path, giving it a higher effective angle of attack. Conversely, the outer wing is descending more steeply, giving it a lower angle of attack. The reduced lift from the outer wing's lower AoA often cancels out the increased lift from its higher speed. As a result, there is little difference in lift between the two wings, and the aircraft shows little to no tendency to overbank.

As the bank angle becomes steeper, a larger portion of the total lift is directed horizontally, leaving less to oppose weight. To compensate and maintain altitude, the pilot must increase the overall lift by increasing the angle of attack. This increase in the total lift force relative to the aircraft's weight is the load factor, which increases exponentially with the bank angle.

      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "brief": "The overbanking tendency is a natural effect in any turn. The wing on the outside of the turn must fly along a larger circle than the inner wing, meaning it has a higher true airspeed. This higher speed causes it to generate more lift, creating a rolling moment that tends to increase the bank angle.",
      "detailed": "When an aircraft is in a turn, it pivots about a central point. This means that the outer wingtip has a greater distance to travel to complete a circle compared to the inner wingtip. Since both wings complete the circle in the same amount of time, the outer wing must be travelling at a higher velocity. According to the lift formula, lift is proportional to the square of the velocity (V²). Therefore, the faster-moving outer wing produces more lift than the slower-moving inner wing. This lift imbalance creates a continuous rolling moment that will try to steepen the bank, and the pilot must apply a small amount of opposite aileron to maintain a constant bank angle.

      "brief": "Aileron drag, which causes adverse yaw, is a direct result of the lift differential created by the ailerons. The downward-deflected aileron increases the lift on the rising wing, and the unavoidable byproduct of this extra lift is an increase in induced drag.",
      "detailed": "When an aileron is deflected downwards to raise a wing, it increases the camber of that wing section. This increases the coefficient of lift, which is the desired effect. However, a fundamental principle of aerodynamics is that induced drag is proportional to the square of the lift coefficient. Therefore, the wing producing more lift also produces significantly more induced drag. It is this imbalance in induced drag between the two wingtips that creates a yawing moment opposite to the direction of the turn. So, while the aileron itself creates some parasite drag, the primary cause of adverse yaw is the induced drag. From Topic: Control (Section 12.4 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

      "detailed": "The Frise aileron is an aerodynamic solution to the problem of adverse yaw. Its hinge point is set further back than on a conventional aileron. When the pilot commands a roll and the aileron on the descending wing moves upwards, this offset hinge causes the aileron's leading edge to protrude into the smooth airflow beneath the wing. This creates a large amount of parasite drag (form drag). This deliberately created drag on the descending wing is designed to be roughly equal to the high induced drag from the rising wing. By balancing the total drag on both wings, the Frise aileron minimizes adverse yaw and promotes a coordinated turn. From Topic: Control (Section 12.5 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

      "brief": "For a constant angle of bank, the rate of turn is inversely proportional to the true airspeed. Therefore, the slower aircraft (Aircraft A) will complete its turn more quickly and will have a higher rate of turn.",
      "detailed": "The rate of turn is a measure of how quickly an aircraft can change its heading. While a higher speed means the aircraft is moving faster, it also means it must fly a much larger circle for the same bank angle. The increased distance it has to travel in this larger circle outweighs the effect of its higher speed. As a result, the faster aircraft will take longer to complete a 360-degree turn, meaning its rate of turn (degrees per second) is lower. This is why the tightest, fastest turns are performed at lower airspeeds. From Topic: Turning (Section 9.5 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

      "answer": "C",
      "brief": "To maintain altitude in a turn, the wings must generate a total lift force greater than the aircraft's weight. This higher lift requirement is achieved at a higher angle of attack, which significantly increases induced drag, requiring more power to overcome.",
      "detailed": "In a level turn, the lift vector is tilted. Only its vertical component opposes weight. To make this vertical component equal to the aircraft's weight, the total lift must be greater than the weight. The only way to increase lift at a constant airspeed is to increase the angle of attack. A fundamental rule of aerodynamics is that induced drag is a byproduct of lift; therefore, as lift increases, induced drag increases, typically by the square of the load factor. To maintain a constant airspeed against this extra drag, the pilot must increase the engine's thrust by adding power. From Topic: Turning (Section 9.3 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

      "brief": "Aileron drag, or adverse yaw, is most pronounced at low airspeeds and high angles of attack. Under these conditions, the ailerons are less effective and require large deflections, and the high angle of attack means induced drag is already the dominant drag force.",
      "detailed": "Adverse yaw is caused by the increased induced drag from the downward-deflected aileron on the rising wing. This effect is most powerful under conditions where induced drag is already high—namely, at low airspeeds and high angles of attack. In a slow turn, for example, the pilot needs to use a large aileron deflection to get the aircraft to roll. This large deflection creates a significant increase in lift on the outer wing, which in turn creates a very large amount of induced drag, causing a powerful yawing moment. At high speeds, the ailerons are very effective, and only small inputs are needed, so the adverse yaw is negligible. From Topic: Control (Section 12.4 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

      "brief": "A Frise aileron is designed with an offset hinge so that when it deflects upwards, its leading edge drops into the airflow. This creates a significant amount of parasite drag on the descending (inside) wing, which helps to balance the drag forces and reduce adverse yaw.",
      "detailed": "The Frise aileron is a clever piece of aerodynamic engineering designed to create a drag force that counteracts adverse yaw. When a pilot initiates a roll, the aileron on the descending wing moves up. Due to its offset hinge, the leading edge of this aileron protrudes into the smooth airflow under the wing, creating substantial form drag. This intentionally created parasite drag on the descending wing is designed to be approximately equal to the increased induced drag on the rising wing. This balancing of the drag forces on both wingtips results in a more coordinated turn with less need for rudder input. From Topic: Control (Section 12.5 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics).",

      "detailed": "The concept of a standard rate turn is crucial for instrument flying, as it allows pilots to make timed turns with a predictable outcome. A Rate 1 turn is defined as turning at 3 degrees every second. Since a full circle has 360 degrees, the time to complete the turn is 360 / 3 = 120 seconds, or 2 minutes. While the angle of bank required to achieve this rate changes with airspeed, the rate of turn itself remains constant.

      "brief": "The overbanking tendency is most pronounced in a climbing turn. This is because the outer wing is not only travelling faster, but it is also on the 'up-going' side of the climb, giving it a higher effective angle of attack and creating significantly more lift.",
      "detailed": "In a level turn, the overbanking tendency is caused solely by the outer wing's higher speed. In a climbing turn, this effect is amplified. The aircraft is flying in an upward spiral. This means the outer wing is travelling on a longer, ascending path, which gives it a higher angle of attack relative to the airflow than the inner wing. The combination of both a higher airspeed AND a higher angle of attack causes the outer wing to generate substantially more lift. This creates a very strong rolling moment that the pilot must actively counter with opposite aileron. From Topic: Turning (Section 9.10 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics).",

At a higher speed, the aircraft has more inertia and is more resistant to turning. To make it turn requires a larger centripetal force, which at a constant bank angle, can only be achieved by flying a larger radius. The formula Radius = V² / (g * tan(bank angle)) shows this relationship clearly. As the velocity (V) increases, the radius increases by the square of that change, resulting in a significantly wider turn. From Topic: Turning (Section 9.5, Figure 9.9 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics).",

The Frise aileron (top of diagram) is a matter of shape; its leading edge is designed to dip into the airflow when deflected up, creating form drag.

To counteract this and force the aircraft to maintain the original, tighter radius, the pilot needs to generate a much larger centripetal force. The only way to do this is by increasing the angle of bank. Therefore, to fly a constant-radius turn at a higher speed, a steeper bank angle is always required.

Conversely, the slower inner wing is descending less steeply, giving it a higher angle of attack.
