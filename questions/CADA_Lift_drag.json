      "answer": "B",
      "brief": "An increase in weight requires the wings to produce more lift at all speeds. This results in higher induced drag, which shifts the entire total drag curve upwards and moves the minimum drag point to a higher airspeed (to the right).",
      "detailed": "When an aircraft's weight is increased, it must generate more lift to maintain level flight. To do this at any given airspeed, the pilot must increase the angle of attack, which in turn significantly increases the induced drag component. This increase in induced drag raises the total drag at every point along the curve. Consequently, the entire U-shaped total drag curve shifts upwards, indicating higher drag at all speeds. Furthermore, the lowest point of the curve (the minimum drag speed) also moves to the right, meaning a heavier aircraft must fly faster to be at its most efficient.

The greatest efficiency is achieved when the aircraft is generating the required lift with the least amount of drag. This occurs at the specific angle of attack where the ratio of Lift to Drag (CL/CD) is at its maximum. Flying at the airspeed corresponding to this angle ensures that the minimum amount of thrust is needed to maintain flight, leading to the best fuel economy over distance.

      "detailed": "The lift formula (Lift = CL x ½ρV² x S) shows the relationship between all the factors that produce lift. To find the minimum possible flight speed (the stall speed), we can rearrange the formula. At this speed, Lift must equal Weight, and the wing is operating at its maximum possible lift coefficient, CLmax. The formula reveals that the stalling speed is inversely proportional to the square root of CLmax. Therefore, a wing that can generate a higher CLmax (e.g., with flaps extended) will be able to fly at a lower speed before it stalls. From Topic: Stalling (Section 10.3 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

      "detailed": "This is a slightly complex relationship. The drag formula is Drag = CD x (½ρV²) x S. A pilot maintains a constant IAS, which means they are maintaining a constant dynamic pressure (½ρV²). However, dynamic pressure itself is made of two components: density (ρ) and true airspeed (V). As the aircraft climbs, density (ρ) decreases. To keep the dynamic pressure constant (and thus the IAS constant), the true airspeed (V) must increase. Even though the aircraft is flying faster through the air (higher TAS), the lower density means there are fewer air molecules to resist the motion, resulting in a lower overall drag force for that given IAS.

When an aircraft is in a steep turn, the wings must support not only the aircraft's weight but also the centripetal force required for the turn, resulting in a higher load factor.

      "detailed": "When an aircraft's weight is reduced, the lift required to maintain altitude at a constant Indicated Airspeed also reduces. To produce less lift, the pilot must lower the angle of attack. Induced drag is directly proportional to the angle of attack (or the lift coefficient). Therefore, as the angle of attack is lowered, the induced drag decreases. Since parasite drag remains constant for a constant IAS, and the induced drag component has decreased, the sum of the two—the total drag—must also decrease. This is why an aircraft becomes more fuel-efficient and requires less thrust as it becomes lighter during a long flight. From Topic: Aerodynamics Final Test No 2, Question 13.",
