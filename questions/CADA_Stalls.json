      "answer": "C",
      "brief": "One of the most recognizable symptoms of an impending stall is aerodynamic buffet. This is a shaking or vibration caused by the turbulent airflow from the separating boundary layer striking the tail surfaces of the aircraft.",
      "detailed": "As an aircraft approaches its critical angle of attack, the smooth, laminar airflow over the top of the wings begins to separate and become turbulent. This disturbed, swirling air flows backwards and strikes the horizontal tailplane and elevator. This impact creates a noticeable vibration or shaking that is felt by the pilot through the airframe and the control column. This buffet is a crucial aerodynamic warning that the wing is close to stalling and that immediate action, such as lowering the angle of attack, is required to prevent a full stall from occurring. Other symptoms include sluggish or 'mushy' controls and the activation of a stall warning horn or light."

        "Because there is a strong headwind"
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "brief": "The indicated stalling speed increases when the load factor ('G' force) on the aircraft increases. During a steep turn, the wings must generate lift greater than the aircraft's weight, causing them to stall at a higher airspeed.",
      "detailed": "The published stalling speed (Vs) is for straight and level flight at a 1G load factor. However, the stall is determined by the angle of attack, not speed. In any manoeuvre that increases the load factor, such as a turn or a pull-up, the wings must produce more lift to support the apparent weight. To generate this extra lift, the wing must fly at a higher angle of attack for any given speed. This means the critical (stalling) angle of attack will be reached at a higher indicated airspeed. For example, in a 60-degree bank turn (2G), the stalling speed increases by approximately 40%. Other factors like a forward CG, ice, or flap retraction also increase the stalling speed."

      "answer": "A",
      "brief": "In a climbing turn, the outer (or 'up-going') wing is travelling faster and also has a slightly higher angle of attack due to the spiral flight path. This combination of higher speed and higher AoA means it is working harder and will stall first.",
      "detailed": "In any turn, the outer wing travels faster than the inner wing. In a climbing turn, the aircraft is following an upward spiral. This means the outer wing is not only moving faster horizontally but is also on the 'rising' side of the spiral, which gives it a higher effective angle of attack compared to the inner wing. This combination means the outer wing is generating significantly more lift and is therefore closer to its critical angle of attack. As the stall is approached, the outer, up-going wing will reach its critical angle first, lose lift, and drop, potentially leading to a spin entry."

      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "brief": "Using aileron to raise a dropped wing during a stall is dangerous because the down-going aileron increases the angle of attack on that wing. This pushes the already-stalled wing deeper into the stall, increasing its drag and causing it to drop further, which can lead to a spin.",
      "detailed": "When a wing drops during a stall, the pilot's instinctive reaction might be to use opposite aileron to raise it. For a left wing drop, this would mean moving the control stick to the right, which deflects the left aileron downwards. However, deflecting an aileron downwards increases the camber of that wing section, which also increases its effective angle of attack. Since the left wing is already stalled, this action will push it even further beyond its critical angle of attack. This deepens the stall on that wing, dramatically increases its drag, and causes it to drop more aggressively, often leading to the aircraft entering an autorotation, which is a spin."

      "brief": "While the indicated airspeed at which a stall occurs can change with weight, load factor, and other variables, the stall itself is a purely aerodynamic event. For a given wing configuration, it will always occur at the same critical angle of attack.",
      "detailed": "This is the most fundamental concept of stalling. A stall is not caused by low airspeed; it is caused by exceeding the wing's critical angle of attack. The indicated stalling speed is simply the speed at which the critical angle is reached in 1G, straight and level flight. If you increase the aircraft's weight or pull it into a steep turn (increasing the load factor), you will reach that same critical angle of attack at a much higher indicated airspeed. The speed changes, but the angle does not. This is why pilots are trained to manage their angle of attack, not just their airspeed, to avoid a stall."

      "detailed": "The dynamics of a descending turn are the opposite of a climbing turn. While the outer wing is still travelling faster horizontally, the aircraft is on a downward spiral path. This means the inner wing is actually rising relative to the flight path, which gives it a higher angle of attack. Conversely, the outer wing is descending more steeply, giving it a lower angle of attack. In this case, the higher angle of attack on the inner wing is the dominant factor, causing it to reach its critical angle and stall first.

      "detailed": "A stall is caused by one thing: an excessive angle of attack. Therefore, the recovery must address this root cause directly. The immediate and primary action is to reduce the angle of attack by moving the control column forward. This lowers the aircraft's nose, decreases the angle between the chord line and the relative airflow, and allows smooth airflow to reattach to the wing surface. Once the wing is unstalled, other actions like applying full power to minimize height loss and using rudder to level the wings can be taken.

A spin is an aggravated stall where at least one wing is deeply stalled. This stalled condition creates a massive amount of drag, which acts as a brake and keeps the forward airspeed low and stable. The aircraft is descending in a helical path, but its speed along that path is not increasing. In contrast, a spiral dive is an unstalled condition where the airspeed is high and rapidly increasing.

      "detailed": "In a straight and level stall, both wings are flying at the same speed and will ideally stall at roughly the same time, usually resulting in a simple nose drop. However, in a turn, there is an inherent asymmetry. The outer wing travels faster and generates more lift than the inner wing. This means the two wings will reach their critical angle of attack at slightly different times. Typically, the inner wing stalls first in a level turn. This sudden loss of lift on one side creates a strong rolling moment, causing the wing to drop abruptly. This combination of yaw and roll is the perfect recipe for entering a spin, making a turning stall significantly more hazardous.",

      "detailed": "The stalling speed is inversely related to the maximum lift coefficient (CLmax). Any device that increases CLmax will decrease the stalling speed. Flaps are designed to do exactly this. By extending, they increase the curvature (camber) of the wing, which allows it to generate more lift at any given angle of attack. This means the total lift required to support the aircraft's weight can be generated at a lower airspeed. In contrast, increasing weight, increasing the load factor, or moving the CG forward all have the effect of increasing the indicated stalling speed because they require the wing to work harder.",

At a very high angle of attack (24 degrees), well beyond the critical angle, the airflow has almost completely separated from the upper surface, creating a large, turbulent wake. This demonstrates that a stall is not an instantaneous event but a progression of airflow separation that intensifies with increasing angle of attack.

As shown in the diagram, the dropping wing has a higher angle of attack and more drag, while the rising wing has less lift and drag. Using aileron would worsen this situation. The standard spin recovery technique, which also applies here, is to first move the control column forward to reduce the angle of attack and unstall both wings. Simultaneously, full opposite rudder must be applied to stop the yawing and rolling motion.

In a turn, the total lift produced must be greater than the aircraft's weight to both maintain altitude and provide the turning force. This increased demand for lift means the critical angle of attack will be reached at a higher airspeed. The table quantifies this relationship: the stall speed in a 60-degree bank (2G load factor) is 84 knots, a significant increase from the level flight stall speed of 60 knots.

First, the high-speed airflow from the propeller (the slipstream) flows over the section of the wing directly behind it.

Second, at the high angle of attack associated with a stall, the thrust line is pointed upwards.

        "detailed": "Flaps are high-lift devices designed to alter the shape of the wing by increasing its camber and sometimes its surface area. This change significantly increases the wing's maximum lift coefficient (CLmax). According to the lift formula, a higher CLmax means that the lift required to support the aircraft's weight can be generated at a lower dynamic pressure, and therefore a lower Indicated Airspeed. This is a critical function that allows aircraft to fly at much slower, safer speeds during takeoff and landing approaches, providing a greater margin from the stall.

        "brief": "An accelerated stall occurs when a high load factor is imposed on the aircraft. The abrupt pull-up demands a large amount of lift, which can cause the wing to exceed its critical angle of attack at a speed well above its normal 1G stalling speed.",
        "detailed": "A stall is not a function of low airspeed, but of exceeding the critical angle of attack. In a sharp pull-up, the pilot is commanding a rapid increase in lift, which imposes a high load factor (G-force) on the airframe. To generate this immense lift, the wings must be flown at a very high angle of attack. If the control input is aggressive enough, the wing's critical angle can be exceeded even when the aircraft is flying very fast. This is why it is called an 'accelerated' stall—it is a stall that occurs during acceleration (in this case, a vertical acceleration or change in flight path).

Firstly, the high-speed airflow from the propeller, known as the slipstream, flows over the section of the wing directly behind it.

Secondly, at the high angle of attack associated with a stall, the thrust line is pointing slightly upwards. This means a vertical component of the engine's thrust is directly opposing the aircraft's weight.

The wing stalls at a specific angle of attack, which corresponds to a specific minimum required dynamic pressure to generate lift equal to the aircraft's weight. At high altitudes, the air density (ρ) is much lower. To achieve the same required dynamic pressure, the aircraft must fly at a much higher true airspeed (V). The airspeed indicator is ingeniously designed to automatically compensate for this. It measures the actual dynamic pressure and displays it as an Indicated Airspeed.

As the aircraft approaches the stall, this wing will reach its critical angle first. When it stalls, it loses lift, while the opposite wing is still producing lift. This imbalance in the lifting forces across the wingspan creates a strong rolling moment, causing the stalled wing to drop."
