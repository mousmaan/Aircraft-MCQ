      "brief": "In steady, straight and level flight, the aircraft is in a state of equilibrium. This means all opposing forces are perfectly balanced: the upward force of Lift exactly equals the downward force of Weight, and forward Thrust equals rearward Drag.",
      "detailed": "For an aircraft to be in a state of unaccelerated, straight and level flight, it must be in equilibrium. This means there is no net force acting on it, and therefore no change in its motion. This requires two specific conditions to be met simultaneously. Firstly, the vertical forces must be balanced, meaning the Lift generated by the wings must be exactly equal to the total Weight of the aircraft. If lift were greater, the aircraft would climb. Secondly, the horizontal forces must also be balanced, meaning the Thrust produced by the engine must be exactly equal to the total Drag resisting the aircraft's motion. If thrust were greater, the aircraft would accelerate. From Topic: The Basics - Equilibrium (Section 1.6 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics).",

      "brief": "In a steady climb, Lift is actually less than Weight. This is because the Thrust vector is tilted upwards, and a vertical component of Thrust helps to support the aircraft's weight, meaning the wings do not need to generate as much lift.",
      "detailed": "This is a commonly misunderstood concept. In a climb, the aircraft's flight path is inclined upwards. As a result, the Thrust line is also pointed upwards, not horizontally. Because of this inclination, the Thrust vector can be resolved into two components: one acting forward along the flight path, and one acting vertically upwards. This vertical component of thrust directly opposes a portion of the aircraft's Weight. Since part of the weight is being supported by the engine's thrust, the wings are relieved of some of their load. Therefore, the Lift generated by the wings (which always acts perpendicular to the flight path) only needs to support the remaining portion of the weight.

One component acts perpendicular to the flight path and is opposed by Lift. The other component acts forward, along the flight path. This forward-acting component of weight helps to pull the aircraft through the air, effectively assisting the engine. Because a portion of the drag is being overcome by gravity, the engine's Thrust does not need to overcome the entire drag force.

According to Newton's laws, this acceleration requires a force, known as the centripetal force. This force is generated by the pilot banking the aircraft. When banked, the total lift force, which is always perpendicular to the wings, is now tilted inwards. This tilted lift vector can be resolved into two components: a vertical component that continues to oppose weight, and a horizontal component that points towards the center of the turn. It is this horizontal component of lift that provides the required centripetal force to pull the aircraft around the corner. From Topic: Turning (Section 9.1 & 9.2 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics).",

The total force opposing the aircraft's forward motion is the sum of two things: the total aerodynamic Drag, plus a component of the aircraft's Weight that acts backwards along the inclined flight path. To overcome both of these rearward forces and maintain a constant climbing speed, the Thrust produced by the engine must be greater than the Drag alone.

For the aircraft to maintain its altitude and not slip into a descent, the vertical forces must remain balanced. This means that the upward-acting vertical component of lift must be precisely equal to the downward-acting force of Weight. Because the total lift is tilted, the pilot must increase the overall lift (by increasing the angle of attack) to ensure that its vertical component is still strong enough to equal the aircraft's weight.

This is achieved by pitching the aircraft's nose down, creating a descending flight path. On this inclined path, the aircraft's total weight (acting vertically downwards) can be resolved into two components: one acting perpendicular to the flight path, and one acting forward along the flight path. It is this forward component of weight that provides the 'thrust' needed to balance the aircraft's total drag, allowing it to maintain a stable gliding speed.

When an aircraft turns, the pilot must increase the angle of attack to generate more total lift, as only the vertical component of that lift is opposing weight. In a mathematically balanced 60-degree banked turn, the geometry of the forces dictates that the total lift required is precisely double the aircraft's weight. The occupants would feel this as a 2G force pushing them into their seats. This increased load factor also increases the stalling speed of the aircraft.

In level flight, the forces are in simple equilibrium: Lift = Weight and Thrust = Drag. However, in a climb, the flight path is inclined. This inclination means that Thrust must now overcome not only the Drag but also a rearward component of the aircraft's Weight acting along the flight path. Therefore, for a climb to be possible, Thrust must be greater than Drag. This 'excess thrust' is what powers the climb.

A steady climb or descent at a constant airspeed is a state of equilibrium because even though the aircraft is moving vertically, its velocity is constant. Straight and level flight at a constant airspeed is also equilibrium. However, the act of *entering* a turn requires the aircraft to start accelerating towards the center of the turn.

If the pilot flies at a speed lower than Vx, the aircraft is on the 'back side' of the thrust curve, where drag is higher, reducing the surplus thrust and making the climb angle shallower. If the pilot flies faster than Vx, parasite drag increases, which also reduces the surplus thrust available for the climb. Therefore, any deviation from the published Vx speed will result in a lower climb angle. A headwind or a reduction in weight would actually increase the climb angle.

The formula shows that turn radius is proportional to the square of the velocity (Radius ∝ TAS²).

Therefore, if a pilot maintains a 30-degree bank at 100 knots IAS at sea level, and then climbs to 10,000 feet while still holding the same bank and 100 knots IAS, their TAS will be significantly higher.

When flying into a 20-knot headwind, the air is flowing over the wings 20 knots faster than the aircraft's ground speed would suggest. If this headwind suddenly disappears, the aircraft momentarily loses that 20 knots of airflow. This causes an instant drop in IAS and a corresponding reduction in lift. With lift now less than weight, the aircraft will begin to sink, causing the rate of descent to increase.

The relationship is that the new stalling speed is the original stalling speed multiplied by the square root of the load factor. In a 75-degree banked turn, the load factor is approximately 4 Gs.

If two aircraft are to maintain the same rate of turn (e.g., a standard Rate 1 turn of 360 degrees in 2 minutes), the one with the higher true airspeed must use a greater angle of bank to achieve it.

        "brief": "Exceeding the load factor limit means structurally over-stressing the airframe. This is most likely to happen if a pilot applies a high bank angle (which demands a high load factor) while flying at a high speed (above Va, the manoeuvring speed).",
        "detailed": "The load factor in a turn increases exponentially with the angle of bank. While a high bank angle itself creates a high load, the danger of structural failure is greatest when this is combined with high speed. Va (Design Maneuvering Speed) is the speed at which full or abrupt control inputs can be made without over-stressing the airframe. If a pilot is flying faster than Va and applies a large control input to enter a steep bank, the aerodynamic forces generated can be immense, potentially exceeding the aircraft's structural limits and causing damage. At or below Va, the aircraft is designed to stall before it can be over-stressed. From Topic: Load Factor and Structural Limitations (Exercise A5, Question 23 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics).",

At this moment, the wingtip vortices will develop to their full strength, causing an abrupt increase in induced drag.

First, the radius of the turn increases significantly (proportional to the square of the velocity). Second, the rate of turn (degrees per second) is affected. The rate of turn is inversely proportional to the speed. This means that as you fly faster, you turn more slowly.

        "detailed": "When initiating a roll, the aileron on the up-going wing moves down, increasing the wing's camber and thus its lift. A fundamental consequence of creating lift is the creation of induced drag. This means the up-going wing now has more lift and more drag than the down-going wing. This imbalance of drag forces between the wingtips creates a yawing moment that is adverse, or opposite, to the direction of the turn. This effect is most pronounced at low airspeeds and high angles of attack, where large aileron deflections are required. It is corrected by applying rudder in the direction of the turn.

It is important to remember that velocity is a vector, having both a magnitude (speed) and a direction. In a steady climb, both the speed and the direction of the flight path are constant.

        "detailed": "The stalling speed of an aircraft increases significantly in a turn because of the increased load factor. The formula to calculate the new stalling speed is: Stall Speed in Turn = Level Stall Speed x √Load Factor. For a 60° bank, the load factor is 2G. The square root of 2 is approximately 1.414. Therefore, the new stalling speed will be 60 kt x 1.414 ≈ 84.84 kt. The closest answer is 85 kt.

        "detailed": "The physics of a turn involves a precise relationship between bank, speed, and the resulting rate and radius. The rate of turn is calculated based on the horizontal component of lift (which is a function of bank angle) and the aircraft's inertia (which is a function of its speed). A higher bank angle provides a greater turning force, increasing the rate of turn. A higher true airspeed means the aircraft has more momentum and is harder to turn, so for a given bank angle, it will result in a lower rate of turn.

The forces pushing the aircraft forward are the thrust from the engine and a component of the aircraft's weight that acts along the downward-sloping flight path. The force resisting this motion is the total aerodynamic drag. Therefore, for the forces to be in equilibrium, Drag must be equal to the sum of the Thrust and the forward component of Weight.

        "brief": "In a turn, the wing on the outside of the turn must fly along a larger circle than the inner wing. This means it travels at a higher true airspeed, generates more lift, and creates a rolling moment that tends to increase the bank angle.",
        "detailed": "When an aircraft turns, it pivots about a point. The outer wing has a longer path to follow than the inner wing, and since both complete their path in the same amount of time, the outer wing must have a higher velocity. According to the lift formula, lift is proportional to the square of the velocity. Therefore, the faster-moving outer wing produces more lift than the slower-moving inner wing. This lift differential creates a rolling moment that will try to continue rolling the aircraft into the turn. The pilot must apply a small amount of opposite aileron to hold a constant bank angle.

        "detailed": "Adverse yaw is the tendency of an aircraft to yaw opposite to the direction of a roll, caused by the drag from the downward-deflected aileron. A differential aileron system is a mechanical solution to this problem. The control linkage is designed so that the up-going aileron (on the wing that is dropping) deflects through a greater angle than the down-going aileron. This increased upward deflection creates significant parasite drag on the descending wing. This extra drag helps to counteract the induced drag from the rising wing, keeping the nose of the aircraft pointed correctly into the turn.

A tailwind is simply that airmass moving over the ground.

When the wings are banked, this lift vector is tilted. We can resolve this tilted vector into two parts: a vertical component and a horizontal component. The horizontal component is what makes the aircraft turn. The vertical component is what keeps the aircraft from descending. For the vertical forces to be in equilibrium, this vertical component must be equal to the aircraft's weight.

The primary effect is a reduction in induced drag, which makes the aircraft more efficient and can cause it to float during landing. It can also cause the airspeed indicator to over-read due to changes in static pressure. However, its effect on stability is often overlooked. The ground interferes with the downwash from the wings flowing over the tailplane. This reduction in downwash reduces the tailplane's effectiveness and its nose-down balancing force, which results in a decrease in longitudinal stability.

This weight can be resolved into two components: one acting perpendicular to the flight path, and one acting parallel to it, but rearwards. This rearward component of weight is effectively trying to make the aircraft slide backwards down its flight path. Therefore, to maintain a steady climb, the engine's thrust must be powerful enough to overcome both the total aerodynamic drag and this rearward component of weight.

        "detailed": "A spin cannot occur unless the aircraft is stalled first. The stall is the necessary prerequisite. However, a simple stall will usually result in a nose drop. To make the aircraft spin, a yawing force must be introduced while the wings are stalled. This yaw causes one wing to move slightly faster than the other, creating a difference in lift and drag between the two stalled wings. This imbalance is what initiates the autorotation, where the aircraft begins to rotate about its vertical axis as it descends.
