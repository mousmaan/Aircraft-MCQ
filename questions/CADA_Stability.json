      "detailed": "Longitudinal stability is the aircraft's ability to resist pitching up or down. This is primarily provided by the downward force from the tailplane, which acts like a lever to balance the aircraft. The length of this lever is the distance from the CG to the tailplane. When the CG is moved aft, this lever arm becomes shorter, reducing the tailplane's effectiveness. If the CG moves too far aft, the tailplane may not have enough authority to counteract any nose-up tendencies, making the aircraft longitudinally unstable and extremely dangerous to fly. An aft CG also makes stall recovery more difficult. From Topic: Stability (Section 11.3 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

      "detailed": "Dihedral enhances roll stability through its effect during a sideslip. When a disturbance causes a wing to drop, the aircraft begins to slip towards that low wing. Due to the dihedral angle, the lower wing meets the relative airflow at a higher angle of attack than the raised wing. This increased angle of attack generates more lift on the low wing, creating a rolling moment that raises it back towards the level position.

      "detailed": "When an aircraft with swept wings sideslips (for example, to the left), the left wing becomes more perpendicular to the relative airflow, while the right wing becomes even more swept. The left (forward-going) wing now behaves like a wing with a lower sweep angle, which makes it more effective at producing lift. Conversely, the right wing becomes less effective. This difference in lift between the two wings creates a powerful rolling moment that tries to raise the left wing, restoring the aircraft to a wings-level attitude.

      "detailed": "High-wing aircraft benefit from two sources of natural lateral stability. The first is the pendulum effect: because the aircraft's Centre of Gravity is below the wing's Centre of Lift, gravity will naturally try to pull the fuselage back to the lowest point, restoring the wings to level flight. The second is the keel effect: during a sideslip, the large side area of the fuselage below the wing acts like the keel of a boat, creating a force that helps to level the wings.

When the pilot increases power, the propeller accelerates a large mass of air rearwards. This high-velocity air flows over the top of the horizontal stabilizer. Because this airflow is faster than the surrounding air, it creates a lower static pressure on top of the tailplane, effectively increasing its downward force. This stronger down-load on the tail creates a nose-up pitching moment, which the pilot must counteract by pushing forward on the control column or adjusting the trim.

        "detailed": "While static stability is the initial tendency, dynamic stability is what happens next. A statically stable aircraft will try to return to its original position, but it may overshoot, creating an oscillation. If these oscillations get progressively smaller and eventually stop, the aircraft has positive dynamic stability. If the oscillations remain constant, it has neutral dynamic stability. If the oscillations become progressively larger, the aircraft has negative dynamic stability (it is dynamically unstable), which can be very dangerous. A good aircraft design aims for both positive static and positive dynamic stability. From Topic: Stability (Section 11.1 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

        "detailed": "Control surface flutter is a dangerous aerodynamic phenomenon where, at high speeds, a control surface can begin to oscillate back and forth with increasing violence. This is caused by an interaction between the aerodynamic forces and the inertia of the control surface. By adding a weight (a mass balance) ahead of the hinge line, designers ensure that the control surface's Centre of Gravity (CG) is located directly on the hinge line. This eliminates the inertial moment that can initiate flutter. If the CG were behind the hinge, any small deflection would create an inertial force that causes it to 'overshoot,' leading to self-exciting and potentially catastrophic vibrations.

        "detailed": "Some aircraft, particularly those with all-moving tailplanes (stabilators), can have very light and sensitive controls. This can lead to the pilot making overly large control inputs, especially at high speeds. An anti-balance tab is designed to provide artificial 'feel' and resistance. It is linked to move in the same direction as the control surface. For example, when the pilot moves the stabilator up, the anti-balance tab also moves up. The airflow striking the tab creates a downward force that tries to push the stabilator back down. The pilot must overcome this resistance, which makes the controls feel heavier and more stable.

        "detailed": "This instability is a result of an imbalance between the two horizontal stability types. It typically begins with a small disturbance that causes the aircraft to roll and sideslip. The strong directional stability (from the fin) will yaw the nose into the slip, but the weak lateral stability (from dihedral/sweepback) is not strong enough to level the wings. In fact, the yawing motion causes the outer wing to speed up and generate more lift, which actually increases the bank angle. This creates a vicious cycle: the increasing bank leads to more slip, which leads to more yaw into the turn, which leads to an even steeper bank, resulting in a spiral dive.

The first movement after the 'displacement' is back towards the 'rest position', which shows positive static stability.

This dampening of the oscillations shows that the aircraft has positive dynamic stability. It will, if left alone, eventually settle back into its original, trimmed state of flight.

As the pilot slows the aircraft by raising the nose (increasing the angle of attack), the induced drag increases sharply. This increased drag requires more power to overcome. If the pilot does not add a significant amount of power to counteract this drag, the aircraft will have a power deficit (power required will be greater than power available). This deficit will result in a loss of energy, causing the aircraft to descend.

When the pilot moves the stick to the right, the right aileron goes down to increase lift on that wing. A byproduct of this increased lift is a large increase in induced drag. This extra drag on the right wing acts like a brake, pulling the right wing back and causing the aircraft's nose to yaw to the left. This is 'adverse' because it is opposite to the direction of the turn. Pilots must use coordinated rudder to counteract this yaw and keep the nose aligned.
