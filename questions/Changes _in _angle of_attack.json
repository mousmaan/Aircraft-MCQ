      "brief": "A stall is a purely aerodynamic event defined by the angle of attack. It is the point where the wing has reached its maximum lift, and any further increase in the angle of attack will cause the lift to decrease.",
      "detailed": "A stall is fundamentally a loss of lift that occurs when the wing exceeds its critical angle of attack. As the angle of attack increases, the lift also increases up to a certain point (the stalling angle). Beyond this angle, the airflow over the wing's upper surface separates from the surface, becoming turbulent. This separation disrupts the low-pressure area that generates most of the lift, causing a sudden and significant decrease in the lift force. It is important to remember that a stall can occur at any airspeed if the critical angle of attack is exceeded. From Topic: Stalling (Section 3.4 & 10.1 - Bob Tait CPL Aerodynamics)."

      "detailed": "The lift on a wing is generated by a pressure differential, with a significant area of low pressure (suction) on the upper surface. The point of the absolute lowest pressure is the point of minimum pressure. As the angle of attack increases, this point of minimum pressure not only becomes lower (creating more lift), but it also shifts its position forward along the chord line. This forward movement of the low-pressure area also causes the Centre of Pressure to move forward, which creates a natural nose-up pitching tendency as the aircraft approaches a stall.

If the angle of attack is increased beyond this point, the airflow separates, and lift decreases. If the angle of attack is decreased from this point, the wing is operating at a lower, more stable angle, and is also producing less lift. Therefore, the stalling angle is unique because any deviation from it will cause a reduction in the lift being generated by the wing.

If the angle of attack is increased beyond this point, the smooth airflow over the top of the wing breaks down and separates, creating a large turbulent wake. This separation destroys the low-pressure area responsible for lift, causing the Coefficient of Lift to decrease sharply. At the same time, the turbulent wake creates a large amount of pressure drag, causing the Coefficient of Drag to increase significantly.

However, as the angle of attack increases, the pressure gradient on the upper surface becomes more adverse (pressure increases towards the rear).

      "detailed": "While a laminar boundary layer is smooth and has low drag, it is also delicate and separates easily. A turbulent boundary layer, on the other hand, is characterized by chaotic, swirling eddies. This constant mixing of air energizes the layer, allowing it to adhere to the wing's surface even when faced with an adverse pressure gradient. This property is advantageous as it helps to delay the airflow separation to a higher angle of attack, resulting in a higher maximum lift coefficient.

However, any slight increase in the angle of attack beyond this point will cause the boundary layer to lose energy completely, leading to airflow separation, a turbulent wake, and a sudden loss of lift.

At this angle, the aircraft is at its most efficient, converting height into forward distance at the best possible rate.

At the point of the stall in level flight, Lift equals Weight, and the CL is at its maximum value (CLmax). The formula shows that the stalling speed is inversely proportional to the square root of CLmax. This means that an aerofoil that can achieve a very high CLmax (for example, by using flaps) will have a lower stalling speed than an aerofoil with a lower CLmax.

      "detailed": "Flaps are high-lift devices that work by increasing the wing's camber. This allows the wing to generate much more lift, which is shown on a graph as a significant increase in the value of the maximum lift coefficient (CLmax). Because the aircraft can now generate the required lift at a lower speed, the stalling speed is reduced. However, the highly cambered aerofoil shape is less efficient at high angles of attack. The airflow will separate from the flapped wing at a lower angle than it would from a clean wing. Thus, the overall effect of extending flaps is a higher CLmax, but a lower critical (stalling) angle of attack.",
